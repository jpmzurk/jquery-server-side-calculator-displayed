Jquery Server Side Calculator

## Description

Duration: Two day sprint

This app serves up a basic, one-equation calculator.  It processes each operator displayed +,-,*,/,âˆš as a one-time use calculator. The user is able to re-use the total of any previous equation by selecting the 'use total' button. Only in this way can the calculator be used for compound equations. 

If the user input is entered correctly, the equations are sent to the server, processed and stored there.  The app requests the user-selected equation, with its total, from the server. When it is received it processed and displayed as a list item.  This data resides on the local server created until either the server is turned off or it is removed by the user with the remove/clear buttons. 

The problems here were three fold: 1. how to make the calculator single-use, 2. how store the user equation and total and 3. how to clear all the of users equations from the page.  

In order to make the calculator single-use, the operator buttons are disabled after one is selected.  Conveniently, if the user changes their mind, the disabled buttons can be re-enabled by clicking again on that same operator. In order to ensure correct functionality the user must enter a number in both fields and select an operator to create an equation. A warning is displayed if user clicks "=" and those conditions are not met.  

To solve the problem of storing the user-made data, the client.js file uses a post request with node/express/ajax to send the data to a server. The server then passes the user data to a calculation function to get the total for the equation. Once that is completed it is stored as an array of objects that contain the equations and their totals. A get request then fetches the data and passes to a function that displays the equation with its total on the Dom. The equations can be deleted from the sever one by one with the delete this equation button.  

To clear the history of all equations was accomplished by creating buttons attached with functionality to make a delete request. The delete requests made by one or all buttons corresponding mutate the array of equations on the server. Once the delete response is confirmed from the server the app runs a get request runs to retrieve the updated array from the server.  The updated array, without the removed equation, is displayed on the DOM. 

Finally, key press functionality for the operators, the equals key and return key are included if the user prefers to use those instead.
